# Zero-Day Behavior Fingerprinter

## Overview
The Zero-Day Behavior Fingerprinter is an advanced cybersecurity tool designed to detect unknown zero-day attacks and anomalous system behavior in real-time. It leverages online machine learning algorithms combined with dynamic fuzz testing and comprehensive logging to provide proactive threat detection beyond traditional signature-based methods.

---

## Features
- **Real-time behavior vector collection:** Gathers system metrics such as syscall rates, entropy, fork rates, and zombie process counts.
- **Dynamic fuzz testing:** Executes scripted fuzz scenarios to stress-test the system and uncover rare behavior patterns.
- **Online anomaly detection:** Utilizes incremental learning with Riverâ€™s HalfSpaceTrees and ADWIN drift detection for adaptive anomaly scoring.
- **Alerting and logging:** Generates alerts for anomalies and maintains detailed audit trails in JSON format.
- **Modular architecture:** Components are decoupled for easy extension and maintenance.
- **Unified CLI:** Single entry-point script to run the entire detection pipeline.

## System Components

### 1. Behavior Vector Collector
Polls and normalizes runtime system metrics into structured vectors for ML input.

### 2. Fuzz Testing Module
Runs pre-defined fuzz scripts (e.g., entropy bombs, zombie forks) to induce edge-case system behaviors.

### 3. Online Anomaly Detection Engine
Runs incremental anomaly scoring and drift detection to identify suspicious changes in system behavior.

### 4. Alerting & Logging System
Safely serializes alerts, logs system events with timestamps, and supports audit and forensic analysis.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Zero_Day_Fingerprinter.git
cd Zero_Day_Fingerprinter
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

Run the full detection pipeline with:

```bash
python zero_day.py full
```

Run individual modules or tests by specifying commands:

```bash
python zero_day.py fuzz
python zero_day.py monitor
```

---

## Architecture

The system integrates fuzz testing to stress the environment, continuously collects behavior vectors, runs online ML models for anomaly detection, and logs alerts and audit trails for security analysts.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate more sophisticated online models like Isolation Forest and deep anomaly detectors.
- Add YARA rule-based detection and threat attribution.
- Implement memory analysis and system hooking for deeper behavioral context.
- Enable automatic response actions such as process termination and network isolation.
